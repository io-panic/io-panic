# io-panic

I'm io-panic, because any input and output make me panic, at least from a security point of view.
There's too many things to verify and only insecurity subsist.

# crashdump

Because at some point there will be a failure, sometimes I call myself crashdump.
My head is not any different from a software and sometimes it just crashes [yes, sometimes I sleep].
